Task-1 : Python URL Shortener

This Python script utilizes the pyshorteners library to create a URL shortener. It prompts the user to input a long URL, then generates a shortened version using the TinyURL service. Finally, it displays the shortened URL to the user. It's a handy tool for condensing lengthy URLs into more manageable forms, perfect for sharing and saving characters!

Task-2 : Web browser

This Python script creates a basic web browser interface using Tkinter. It sets up a window titled "Simple Web Browser" with an input field for URLs and a button labeled "Open" to launch the entered URL in the default web browser. The open_url() function retrieves the URL from the input field and uses webbrowser.open() to open it. Operating within a Tkinter event loop, the script ensures continuous user interaction until the main window is closed. In essence, it provides a simple and intuitive way for users to input URLs and navigate to web pages using their default browser.
